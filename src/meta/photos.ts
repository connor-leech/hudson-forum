This is something truly needed on a global scale — a place where leaders in academia, innovation, industry, finance, and philanthropy come together and share ideas and solutions.",
  "The panels were remarkable — I was especially impressed with the panel chairs: they were all dynamic, intelligent, and provocative. Bravo!",
  "Congratulations to the hosts and the team that put this unique program together. It was terrific (just so you can calibrate my compliments, I don’t give them easily).",
  "Stepping out of my routine for two days, learning from thought leaders in their exciting fields, engaging with the amazing talent from IBM and networking with other industry members was refreshing, thought-provoking, and inspiring.",
